The PHP constants `true`, `false`, and `null` MUST be in lower case.

[keywords]: http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.keywords.php


## 6. Classes

Class names MUST be declared in `StudlyCaps`.

The opening brace for the class MUST go on its own line; the closing brace for the class MUST go on
the next line after the body.


### 6.1. Extends and Implements

The `extends` and `implements` keywords MUST be declared on the same line as the class name.


### 6.2. Properties, Constants and Variables

Class constants MUST be declared in all upper case with underscore separators.

Class properties MUST be declared in `camelCaps()`.

There MUST NOT be more than one property declared per statement.

All global variables MUST be declared at first row and all globals MUST be at one line.

~~~php
<?php
namespace Vendor\Model;
class ClassName extends ParentClass implements \ArrayAccess, \Countable
{
	global $fistVar, $secondVar;
	const VERSION = '1.0';
	const DATE_APPROVED = '2012-06-01';
	var $thirdVar;
}
?>
~~~


### 6.3. Methods and Functions

Method names MUST be declared in `StudlyCaps()`.

Visibility MUST be declared on all methods.

Method names SHOULD NOT be prefixed with a single underscore to indicate protected or private visibility.

There MUST be two empty lines before any method.

Method names MUST NOT be declared with a space after the method name. The opening brace MUST go on
its own line, and the closing brace MUST go on the next line following the body.

There MUST NOT be a space after the opening parenthesis, and there MUST NOT be a space before the closing parenthesis.

In the argument list, there MUST NOT be a space before each comma, and there MUST be one space after each comma.

Method arguments with default values MUST go at the end of the argument list.

A method declaration looks like the following. Note the placement of parentheses, commas, spaces, and braces:

~~~php
<?php
namespace Vendor\Package;
class ClassName
{
	var $fistVar;


	public function FirstMethod($arg1, &$arg2, $arg3=[])
	{
		// method body
	}


	public function SecondMethos($arg1, $arg2=null)
	{
		// method body
	}
}
?>
~~~


### 6.4. `abstract`, `final`, and `static`

When present, the `abstract` and `final` declarations MUST precede the visibility declaration.

When present, the `static` declaration MUST come after the visibility declaration.

~~~php
<?php
namespace Vendor\Package;
abstract class ClassName
{
	protected static $fistVar;


	abstract protected function FirstFunc();


	final public static function SecondFunc()
	{
		// body
	}
}
?>
~~~

### 6.5. Method and Function Calls

When making a method or function call, there MUST NOT be a space between the method or function name
and the opening parenthesis, there MUST NOT be a space after the opening parenthesis.

There MUST NOT be a space before the closing parenthesis.

In the argument list, there MUST NOT be a space before each comma, and there MUST be one space after each comma.

~~~php
<?php
FirstFunc();
$fistVar->FirstFunc($arg1);
ClassName::FirstFunc($arg2, $arg3);
?>
~~~

Argument lists MAY be split across multiple lines, where each subsequent line is indented once. When doing so,
the first item in the list MUST be on the next line, and there MUST be only one argument per line.

~~~php
<?php
$fistVar->FirstFunc(
	$longArgument,
	$longerArgument,
	$muchLongerArgument);
?>
~~~


## 7. Control Structures

There MUST be one space after the control structure keyword.

There MUST NOT be a space after the opening parenthesis.

There MUST NOT be a space before the closing parenthesis.

The opening brace MUST go on its own line; the closing brace.

The structure body MUST be indented once.

The closing brace MUST be on the next line after the body.

The body of each structure MUST be enclosed by braces. This standardizes how the structures look, and reduces
the likelihood of introducing errors as new lines get added to the body.


### 7.1. `if`, `elseif`, `else`

An `if` structure looks like the following. Note the placement of parentheses, spaces, and braces.

The keyword `elseif` SHOULD be used instead of `else if` so that all control keywords look like single words.

~~~php
<?php
if ($firstVar == true && $secondVar > 10)
{
	// if body
}
elseif ($firstVar == true || $thirdVar == false)
{
	// elseif body
}
else
{
	// else body;
}
?>
~~~


### 7.2. `switch`, `case`

A `switch` structure looks like the following. Note the placement of parentheses, spaces, and braces.

The `case` statement MUST be indented once from `switch`, and the `break` keyword (or other terminating keyword)
MUST be indented at the same level as the `case` body.

There MUST be a comment such as `// no break` when fall-through is intentional in a non-empty `case` body.

~~~php
<?php
switch ($expr)
{
	case 0:
		echo 'First case, with a break';
		break;
	case 1:
		echo 'Second case, which falls through';
		// no break
	case 2:
	case 3:
	case 4:
		echo 'Third case, return instead of break';
		return;
	default:
		echo 'Default case';
		break;
}
?>
~~~


### 7.3. `while`, `do while`

A `while` statement looks like the following. Note the placement of parentheses, spaces, and braces.

~~~php
<?php
while ($expr)
{
	// structure body
}
?>
~~~

Similarly, a `do while` statement looks like the following. Note the placement of parentheses, spaces, and braces.

~~~php
<?php
do
{
	// structure body;
}
while ($expr);
?>
~~~


### 7.4. `for`

A `for` statement looks like the following. Note the placement of parentheses, spaces, and braces.

~~~php
<?php
for ($i=0; $i<10; $i++)
{
	// for body
}
?>
~~~


### 7.5. `foreach`

A `foreach` statement looks like the following. Note the placement of parentheses, spaces, and braces.

~~~php
<?php
foreach ($iterable as $key=>$value)
{

### 7.6. `try`, `catch`

A `try catch` block looks like the following. Note the placement of parentheses, spaces, and braces.

~~~php

{
	// catch body
}
catch (OtherExceptionType $e)
{
	// catch body
}
?>
~~~


## 8. Operators and Assignment

All Operatoors and Assignments MUST have a single space befor and after them.

Check `Control Structures` for their style.

PHP array MUST be declared such as `array()`. Pay attention to casing and spaces.

Each element of a PHP array MUST be on a new line.

~~~php
<?php
$firstVar = 1;
$firstVar += 1;
$firstVar .= '1';
$firstVar++;
$firstVar = array();
$firstVar = array(
	'first',
	'second',
	0 => 'third');
?>
~~~


## 9. Comments

All JS comments MUST be encapsulated in `/**/`.

All one-line comments in PHP MUST use `// ` only. Mind the space after `//`.

All comments except one-line comments in PHP MUST use `/**/` only.

`/*` and `*/` MUST be on their own lines except for one-line comments in JS.

All lines between `/*` and `*/` MUST start with ` * `. Mind the space before and after `*`.

`DeveloperName`: Each developer MUST indicate start and end of his/her code insertion with the exact following pattern:

`DeveloperName` MUST not indented.

~~~php
<?php
// previous code
//******************************************//
//	Added By FirstName LastName
//	Jan 5, 2000
//******************************************//
// REASON FOR CHANGE
// developers code
//******************************************//
// previous code
?>
